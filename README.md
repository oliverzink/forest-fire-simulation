# This program is a forest fire visualizer/simulation. Using object oriented programming, we were able to simulate how a forest fire might spread in the wild.
# each tree = one pixel, and as it burns, the tree turns from green (healthy) -> yellow/red (burning) -> black (burnt), and has a chance to regrow.
# I co-wrote this program in April/May 2022 with my friend Joey, and the project was assigned by my professor.

Use this format when running the program on the command line (initial forest state file, the file to record the final forest state, and how long to run the program):
